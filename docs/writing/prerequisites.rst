Prerequisites
==============
Below are some suggested tools for writing Poshi

#. Clone `liferay-portal/master`_ to your local machine.
#. Chrome latest version (since tests by default run on Chrome/Chromium on 7.2/master).
#. `Ant`_ (latest version is fine)
#. `Java (JDK 8)`_
#. `Sublime Text 3`_ - To find existing Poshi files, we recommend scoping your portalweb folder (`step #6`_) into a project.
#. To build and/or fix tests quicker, it is recommended to run two console/terminal instances side-by-side: One running your instance of portal on Tomcat; and the other at-the-ready for running automation-related commands.
